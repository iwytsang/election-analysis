* How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
369,711 votes were cast in this congressional election.

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.



* Which county had the largest number of votes?



* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.




* Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?




## Election-Audit Summary
The script can be used for any other election in order to count the candidates, total number of votes, percentage of votes.
To use it for other elections that have more candidates, we could modify the script to only print out the name, number of votes, and percentage of votes for the top 3 candidates in the election. We could also print out the top 3 counties with the most voter turnouts.
