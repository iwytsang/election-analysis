# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to assist Tom and his manager Seth, both Colorado board of elections employees, in an election audit of results. In addition to the breakdown of the results by candidate name, number of votes, and percentage of votes, the election commission also requested some additional data to complete the audit which included the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes for each county, as well as the county with the highest turnout.


## Election-Audit Results
Once the python script was run, the results were saved onto the election_analysis.txt file as shown below.

## Election-Audit Summary
The script can be used for any other election in order to count the candidates, total number of votes, percentage of votes.
To use it for other elections that have more candidates, we could modify the script to only print out the name, number of votes, and percentage of votes for the top 3 candidates in the election. We could also print out the top 3 counties with the most voter turnouts.
